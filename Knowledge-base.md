🌐 Network Topology Scanner & Management System

👉 Overview

This system is a modular network topology scanner with a centralized Core UI that allows multi-location monitoring using distributed Python and Node.js nodes. It provides in-depth scanning, real-time device tracking, and cross-referenced validation using an SQLite3 database.

Key features include:

- **Multi-node support** – Collect and manage data from multiple servers or locations.
- **Wake-on-LAN (WoL)** – Remotely power on/off devices.
- **IP:Port Access** – Direct access to detected services (SSH, RDP, HTTP, etc.).
- **Always-online monitoring** – Alerts for downtime detection.
- **Scheduled Speed Tests** – Detects network performance issues.
- **Self-hosted & Remote Tool Detection** – Recognizes Anydesk, RustDesk, RDP, VNC, and other remote access tools.

🔍 In-Depth Scanning & Device Recognition

The system uses Python for network scanning and Node.js for real-time API processing, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

- **Detects Open Ports** – Identifies all active services, including self-hosted applications.
- **Cross-referencing Database** – Validates scanned data using a structured SQLite3 knowledge base.
- **Protocol & Service Detection** – Recognizes SSH, HTTP, SMB, FTP, and custom self-hosted ports.

🖥️ Core UI Features

The modern, multi-tabbed UI dynamically adapts to scanned results without breaking.

- **Graphical Network Map** – Visualizes devices per location with interactive elements.
- **Dynamic UI Adaptation** – Prevents UI corruption from malformed data (e.g., lovable.dev errors).
- **Direct Service Access** – One-click access to detected services.
- **Historical Data & Logging** – Stores past scans and performance trends.

🔒 Security & User Management

- **Access Control & User Roles** – Admin, viewer, and operator permissions.
- **Remote Command Execution** – Run scripts like system updates and resets.
- **Strict API Contracts** – Ensures scanned data conforms to structured formats.
- **Error Handling & Fallbacks** – Uses default values to prevent data corruption.

📝 Knowledge Base (SQLite3)

The SQLite3 database maintains a structured schema for devices, services, and expected behaviors.

Example:

```json
{
  "device_types": {
    "router": {
      "icon": "router.png",
      "ports": ["80", "443", "22", "23"],
      "protocols": ["HTTP", "HTTPS", "SSH", "Telnet"],
      "ui_rules": {
        "allow_wol": false,
        "allow_remote_access": true
      }
    },
    "server": {
      "icon": "server.png",
      "ports": ["22", "3389", "5900"],
      "protocols": ["SSH", "RDP", "VNC"],
      "ui_rules": {
        "allow_wol": true,
        "allow_remote_access": true
      }
    }
  },
  "ui_fallbacks": {
    "missing_icon": "unknown.png",
    "default_ports": ["80", "443"],
    "default_protocols": ["HTTP", "HTTPS"],
    "invalid_data_handling": "ignore"
  }
}
```

🛠️ Python & Node.js Integration

- **Python scans the network** and collects device details.
- **Node.js validates results** against the SQLite3 database.
- **Cross-referencing prevents mismatches** in UI data.
- **WebSockets enable real-time updates** to reflect status changes instantly.

🚀 Next Steps

- Design a SQL schema for scalable storage.
- Implement real-time monitoring with WebSockets.
- Build a React-based UI for a seamless experience.
- Automate device categorization and alerting mechanisms.

This system ensures reliable network management while preventing UI corruption from unpredictable scan results. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! So to best proceed and keep record I suggest that we create a folder and for every item or section we create we log with a text file per item and date stamp.

Each file would track progress per section, with timestamps to ensure versioning.
